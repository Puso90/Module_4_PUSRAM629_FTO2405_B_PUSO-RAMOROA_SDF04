 Intro to advanced CSS concepts

Thank you all for your patience at CodeSpace.

I chose styles 1, 9 and 5 from the buttons you had offered us to look at and of use as reference.

To be honest I chose the quickest and made minor tweeks to the code because I was really running out of time for submission.

Thanks Ben.  I took the easiest buttons but I will practise all weekend to use what I'm learning to build my website.
