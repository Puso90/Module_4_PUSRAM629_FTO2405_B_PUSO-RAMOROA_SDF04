 Intro to advanced CSS concepts

Thank you all for your patience at CodeSpace.

I chose styles 1, 9 and 5 from the buttons you had offered us to look at and of use as reference.

To be honest I chose the quickest and made minor tweeks to the code because I was really running out of time for submission.

Thanks Ben.  I took the easiest buttons but I will practise all weekend to use what I'm learning to build my website.

Now [Sat,18 May],  I just added some shake/movements on my buttons.  Hope this is okay and I'm also doing this to practice my github on desktop via pull requests, commits and merging with previous work.

Although I find github desktop very unnessasary as my github browser can do what it does and better.
